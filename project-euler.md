Since the limit is 10^6 which mean we only need to check 1998 numbers \([http://oeis.org/A050250](http://oeis.org/A050250)\)

So we can easily bruteforce, checking every product generated by production of three-digits number is palindrome number or not

 

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
	str_num = str(num)
	for i in range(0, len(str_num)):
		if str_num[i] != str_num[len(str_num) - i - 1]:
			return False
	return True

max = 0
max_i = 0
max_j = 0
for i in range(100, 1000):
	for j in range(100, 1000):
		product = i * j
		if is_palindrome(product) == True and product > max:
			max = product
			max_i = i
			max_j = j
print max, max_i, max_j
```

But this is practice, so i will do it in more proper way

First, i need to wrote an algorithm to generate palindrome numbers
