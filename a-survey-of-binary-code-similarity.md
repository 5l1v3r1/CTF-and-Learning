# A Survey of Binary Code Similarity

> Over the past 20 years numerous binary code similarity approaches have been proposed, but the research area has not yet been systematically analyzed.

Understanding what people have done in the past is important because it's not just help you save your time but also expanding your knowledges about the research area or gaining information about the previous problems to know which problems are still left-over or if there is still room left for improvements on a working method. 

To give the reader a big-picture view of Binary Code Similarity, author have done a great job of systematizing 61 approaches by 5 characteristics

> For example, the approach systematization includes, among others, the number of input pieces of binary code being compared \(e.g., oneto- one, one-to-many, many-to-many\); the granularity of the pieces of binary code analyzed \(e.g., basic blocks, functions, programs\); whether the comparison happens at the syntactical representation, the graph structure, or the code semantics; the type of analysis used \(e.g., static, dynamic, symbolic\), and the techniques used for scalability \(e.g., hashing, embedding, indexing\).
